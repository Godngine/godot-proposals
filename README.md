Godot Improvement Proposals
===========================

In order to improve the workflow of proposing, discussing, reviewing
and later on implementing features or enhancements in Godot Engine,
this repository is used to centralize all the proposals in one place
apart from bug reports.

Proposals are made by opening issues in this repository, while will
then be discussed with fellow Godot users and contributors. Once a
proposal is considered good to implement, it will be turned in a formal
Godot Improvement Proposal (GIP) stored in text format in this
repository.

**Note:** Work in progress! Bear with us while we discuss and define
the exact workflow that we want to use.
